# in-date-range

A Lightroom Classic plugin to help setting creation date on a number of images at once. The user specifies a date range within which the creation date should fall. The plugin calculates as many timestamps as selected images and applies a date to each. The dates will be applied in same order as the images. So, for instance, if the images are sorted by file name, the dates will be applied with the oldest date on the first image, etc. 

## Please note

This plugin is in its early stages of development and has not been tested thoroughly. It works in my limited testing, but I will refine it over time. Please try it out, but use at your own risk. I am fairly confident the plugin can do no harm, but it's always good to have a backup of your files, if something should go wrong.
